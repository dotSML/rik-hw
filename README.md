# RIK homework task

This repository contains:
1. [API (`/src/Api`)](src/api/README.md): Backend built with .NET 8.
2. [Client (`/src/Client`)](src/client/README.md): Frontend built with React.

## Quickstart

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET SDK 8.0** (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)

## Starting the application
